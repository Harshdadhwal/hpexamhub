        <div class="content">
            <p class="intro">
                Namaste dear readers! Today I'm going to share my most memorable journey to Chitkul, the last inhabited village on the Indo-Tibetan border. This place is truly something else yaar!
            </p>

            <h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
            <p>
                You know, when we started our journey from Shimla, I was having so much excitement! The winding roads of Himachal Pradesh are no joke, but the views? Absolutely mind-blowing! Every turn was giving us a new panorama of snow-capped peaks and lush green valleys.
            </p>

            <p>
                After crossing Rampur and then Sangla, we were getting closer and closer to our destination. The air was becoming more crisp, the mountains more majestic. My heart was beating fast with anticipation!
            </p>

                <img src="https://static2.tripoto.com/media/filter/nl/img/223647/TripDocument/1503678762_img_20170813_111503.jpg" alt="Mountain Roads of Himachal" class="blog-image">
                <p class="image-caption">The breathtaking mountain roads of Himachal Pradesh</p>
            </div>

            <h2>First Glimpse of Chitkul</h2>
            <p>
                Arre wah! When Chitkul first came into view, I literally got goosebumps. This small village, sitting at 11,319 feet, looked like something straight out of a fairy tale. The Baspa River was flowing with such grace, and the traditional wooden houses with slate roofs - absolutely charming!
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Chitkul is the last point in India where civilians can travel without any special permits. Beyond this, it's all restricted area near the Tibetan border. How cool is that?
            </div>

            <h2>The Village Life</h2>
            <p>
                The people here are so warm and welcoming, I tell you! Despite the harsh winters (the village remains cut off for 6 months!), they maintain such beautiful smiles. The pahadi culture is truly strong here - you can see it in their traditional dress, their wooden temples, and their simple lifestyle.
            </p>

            <p>
                I met one elderly aunty ji who was spinning wool outside her house. She told me stories about how the whole village migrates to lower areas during heavy snowfall. Can you imagine? The entire village, empty for months! Such resilience these people have.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2>The Famous Maa Mathi Temple</h2>
            <p>
                No visit to Chitkul is complete without paying respects at the Maa Mathi Temple. This ancient wooden temple is the heart of the village. The intricate carvings on the wood, done without any modern tools - it's just amazing craftsmanship!
            </p>

            <p>
                The locals believe that Maa Mathi protects the village from all evil. Standing there, with the peaceful atmosphere and the sound of temple bells mixing with the river's flow, I could totally feel the divine presence.
            </p>

            <h2>The Last Dhaba and Indian Post</h2>
            <p>
                You have to visit the "Last Dhaba" and click photos with the famous signboard saying "Last Indian Dhaba"! It's become quite an Instagram spot now, but honestly, the maggi and chai there hits different in that cold weather. Nothing can beat that taste!
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, the Hindustan Ka Akhri Dhaba (India's Last Dhaba) serves the most delicious local cuisine. Try the siddu and trout fish if you're a non-vegetarian - simply superb!
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Travel Tip:</strong> Carry enough cash! There are no ATMs in Chitkul, and internet connectivity is quite poor. Better to be prepared, no?
            </div>

            <div class="quote">
                The mountains are calling, and we must go. But Chitkul? It doesn't just call - it embraces your soul!
            </div>

            <h2>Stargazing Like Never Before</h2>
            <p>
                Oh my God, the night sky in Chitkul! I've never seen so many stars in my entire life. Zero pollution, crystal clear sky - it felt like the entire Milky Way was put on display just for us. We sat outside our homestay wrapped in blankets, sipping hot kahwa, and just gazing at the stars. Truly magical!
            </p>

            <h2>My Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Visiting Chitkul was not just a trip - it was an experience that touched my heart. In today's fast-paced world, this village reminded me of the simple joys of life. The kindness of strangers, the beauty of untouched nature, the strength of community - everything was so pure and genuine.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're thinking of visiting, I would say - don't think twice, just go! But please, please maintain the cleanliness. Don't litter. Respect the local culture. These mountains have given us so much; the least we can do is preserve them for future generations.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I left Chitkul with a heavy heart, I made a promise to myself - I will definitely come back. This last village of India has become a permanent resident in my heart!
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> May to October is ideal. Winter months (November to April) see heavy snowfall and the village becomes inaccessible. Plan accordingly!
            </div>
